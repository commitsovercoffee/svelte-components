# Thy-universe of svelte components

I'm still figuring out the best way to design components. I like to try out different styles before committing to one for a project. This can lead to a lot of versions getting overwritten or lost.

To keep track of my experiments and have reusable components handy, I created this repository. Feel free to use or adapt anything you find here!
